# Curse

A collection of maybe NOT useful Java annotations

This collection includes:

* `de.mirkosertic.curse.WTF`
* `de.mirkosertic.curse.Damn`
* `de.mirkosertic.curse.ThisSucks`
* `de.mirkosertic.curse.BloodyHell`

Maybe these annotations are useful if you are planning a larger legacy code review. 
For starters, every annotation is marked with `de.mirkosertic.curse.GetOutOfHere`.

A major release is planned as soon as all curses are collected and the library is curse-complete. Contributions are welcome!

A follow up release will also include a Curse.js version.
